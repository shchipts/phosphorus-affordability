Competitive equilibrium prices of distributed DAP/MAP commodity market.

World trade in DAP/MAP commodities breaks down into transactions on individual markets
residing at different geographical locations. The markets are linked by the shared access
to a finite pool of international suppliers.  Suppliers differentiate price offers for
distinct markets based on the trade costs. The algorithm runs the generalized English
auction for differentiated markets (Gul & Stacchetti 2000). Executes price adjustment
procedure for different model parameterization provided in input files.
